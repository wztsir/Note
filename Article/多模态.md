## Evaluating and Improving Factuality 

in Multimodal Abstractive Summarization

动机：

Current metrics for evaluating factuality for abstractive document summarization have achieved high correlations with human judgement, but they do not account for the vision modality and thus are not adequate for visionand-language summarization.

解决：

We propose CLIPBERTSCORE, a simple weighted combination of CLIPScore (Hessel et al., 2021) and BERTScore (Zhang* et al., 2020) to leverage the robustness and strong factuality detection performance between image-summary and document-summary, respectively.
